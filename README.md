# CSED421 Database System Project

This repository contains my implementation of the [EDU/COSMOS](https://github.com/odysseus-educosmos/ODYSSEUS-EduCOSMOS) project,
which implements a part of the storage system ODYSSEUS/COSMOS.
This work was done as a course project of **CSED421 Database Systems** course in POSTECH.
The five project folders contain the following:
- Project 1: Course Homework
- Project 2: EduBfM project - implementation of a buffer manager
- Project 3: EduOM project - implementation of page-related structures
- Project 4~5: EduBtM project - implementation of B+ Tree manager
